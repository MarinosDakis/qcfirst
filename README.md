# qcfirst

**QCFirst** is a prototype course enrollment application where users (i.e. students and instructors)
can access features to help simulate an online enrollment environment. 

The following application will contain features of: **User Management**, **Course Management**, and **Enrollment Management**.

**User Management** will focus on creating a responsive environment for both students and instructors when
accessing the course enrollment application.

**Course Management** will be managed by instructors and will allow them to create and delete courses through a database.

**Enrollment Management** will focus on allowing students to register for classes for an upcoming semester.



## Site Map
This is the course enrollment's site map. It will contain essential pages to help a user navigate through all of the website's features.
The rest of the README will contain wireframes for each individual page of the site map and will contain additional information about what a user will
be able to do on each individual webpage(depending on whether they are signed in as a user or instructor).
Each wireframe has its own responsive design transitioning from [Webpage -> Tablet -> Mobile] to ensure that the application is accessible on different platforms.
Each arrow on the site map shows which pages are connected to each other via an internal link; for example, a user will be able to navigate to the Login Page and Create account page from the Home Page.

## Homepage
The Homepage is the root web page that a user will start at. Here a user will be able to choose whether they want to sign in as a student or an instructor.
If a user does not have an account, they will be able to press the sign up hyperlink underneath the buttons to go to the Create Account page.

## Login Page
The Login Page contains textboxes for a user to enter their credentials. Afterwards, they will be redirected to their respected Dashboards.

## Student Dashboard Page
The Student dashboard will contain a list of all the classes a student is registered for for the next upcoming term.

On the top right of the navigation bar a user will be able to log out from their session. Moreover, below the table with the registered class information a user will be able to
navigate to the course dictionary page and the course deadline page. 
The footer will contain information about the signed in user, whenever a user is in an active session.

## HTML Deliverable:

For the first project deliverable we split up the task of creating the HTML for the pages from how we divided the site map originally.
For the navigation bars, I created 3 separate versions for each instance (i.e. no user, student user, and instructor user) of the web application using online resources.
Each instance has different html pages associated with them and will contain their corresponding navigation bar inserted using Javascript.
Similarly, this is done with the footer for the website as well; however it will be placed on all pages of the web application and then modified once a user logs in. 


***Below are some images depicting the custom navigation bars circled in blue:***
(also the html pages for students and instructors can be accessed temporarily via the urls below to look through their associated pages from the navigation bars).

### No user Instance
url: https://bbarua15.github.io/qcfirst/html/homepage-html.html
![alt text](https://github.com/bbarua15/qcfirst/blob/main/Images%20(with%20HTML)/no-user%20instance.png)

### Student Instance
url: https://bbarua15.github.io/qcfirst/html/student-dashboard-html.html
![alt text](https://github.com/bbarua15/qcfirst/blob/main/Images%20(with%20HTML)/student%20instance.png)

### Instructor Instance
url: https://bbarua15.github.io/qcfirst/html/instructor-dashboard-html.html
![alt text](https://github.com/bbarua15/qcfirst/blob/main/Images%20(with%20HTML)/instructor%20instance.png)

The tables located in the HTML contain placeholder values until a database is connected using Node.js.
One modification I may make in the future is to substitute the textfields with Bootstrap to make them more aesthetic to users.

### Navigation bar urls and footer url:

***No-user:*** https://bbarua15.github.io/qcfirst/html/header.html

***Student:*** https://bbarua15.github.io/qcfirst/html/header-student.html

***Instructor:*** https://bbarua15.github.io/qcfirst/html/header-instructor.html

***Footer:*** https://bbarua15.github.io/qcfirst/html/footer.html

The original HTML files for these pages do not contain HTML or head tags since they are inserted into pages that already contain such tags.
