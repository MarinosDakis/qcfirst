# qcfirst

**QCFirst** is a prototype course enrollment application where users (i.e. students and instructors)
can access features to help simulate an online enrollment environment. 

The following application will contain features of: **User Management**, **Course Management**, and **Enrollment Management**.

**User Management** will focus on creating a responsive environment for both students and instructors when
accessing the course enrollment application.

**Course Management** will be managed by instructors that will allow them to create and delete courses inside of a database.

**Enrollment Management** will focus on allowing students to register for classes.



## [Site Map]
This is the course enrollment's site map. It will contain fundamental pages to help a user navigate through all of the website's features.
Below will contain wireframes for each individual section of the site map and will contain additional information about what a user will
be able to access on each individual webpage (depending on whether they are signed in as a user or instructor).
Each wireframe has its own responsive design transitioning from [Webpage -> Tablet -> Mobile] for an excellent responsive environment.

## [STUDENT DASHBOARD]
The Student dashboard will contain a list of all the classes a student is registered for for the next upcoming term.
The dashboard will also contain a navigation bar at the top which will navigate a user to the Add Class Page, the Drop Class Page, and the Change Password Page.

navigate to the course dictionary page and the course deadline page. 
The footer will contain information about the signed in user, whenever a user is in an active session.

## [CHANGE PASSWORD INSTRUCTOR]
The change password page is straight forward. Here a user will be able to change their password by entering the correct credentials and then inputting a new password.
The password will then be validated to make sure that it is secure (similarly this happens when a user creates their account).
