# qcfirst

**QCFirst** is a prototype course enrollment application where users (i.e. students and instructors)
can access features to help simulate an online enrollment environment. 

The following application will contain features of: **User Management**, **Course Management**, and **Enrollment Management**.

**User Management** will focus on creating a responsive environment for both students and instructors when
accessing the course enrollment application.

**Course Management** will be managed by instructors that will allow them to create and delete courses inside of a database.

**Enrollment Management** will focus on allowing students to register for classes.



## [Site Map]
This is the course enrollment's site map. It will contain fundamental pages to help a user navigate through all of the website's features.
Below will contain wireframes for each individual section of the site map and will contain additional information about what a user will
be able to access on each individual webpage (depending on whether they are signed in as a user or instructor).
Each wireframe has its own responsive design transitioning from [Webpage -> Tablet -> Mobile] for an excellent responsive environment.
